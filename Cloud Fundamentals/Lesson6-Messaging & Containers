Simple Notification Service
-------------------------

    Amazon Simple Notification Service (or SNS) is a cloud service that allows you to send notifications to the users of your applications. SNS allows you to decouple the notification logic from being embedded in your applications and allows notifications to be published to a large number of subscribers.

    Features
        SNS uses a publish/subscribe model.
        SNS can publish messages to Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.

    Tips
        SNS is found under the Application Integration section on the AWS Management Console.
        SNS Topic names are limited to 256 characters.
        A notification can contain only one message.

Simple Queue Service
-------------------------

    Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to integrate queuing functionality in your application. SQS offers two types of message queues: standard and FIFO.

    Features
        send messages
        store messages
        receive messages

    Tips
        The Simple Queue Service (SQS) is found under the Application Integration on the AWS Management Console.
        FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second.
        FIFO queues guarantee the ordering of messages.
        Standard queues offer best-effort ordering but no guarantees.
        Standard queues deliver a message at least once, but occasionally more than one copy of a message is delivered.

What is Elastic Container Service (ECS)?
-------------------------

    ECS is an orchestration service used for automating deployment, scaling, and managing of your containerized applications. ECS works well with Docker containers by:
        launching and stopping Docker containers
        scaling your applications
        querying the state of your applications

    Tips
        ECS falls under the Compute section on the AWS Management Console.
        You can schedule long-running applications, services, and batch processeses using ECS.
        Docker is the only container-runtime platform supported by Amazon ECS. Other container-runtime tools available in the insdustry are Rocket, LXD, OpenVZ, any a few more.
