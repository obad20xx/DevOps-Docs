Elastic Block Store
-------------------------
    Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a storage solution for EC2 instances and is a physical hard drive that is attached to the EC2 instance to increase storage.

    Tips
        EBS is found on the EC2 Dashboard.
        There are several EBS volume types that fall under the categories of Solid State Drives (SSD) and Hard Disk Drives (HDD).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Volume Types
-------------------------
    AWS allows the following types of volumes to be created. Each type of volume has its service capacity. Choose a type based on the underlying application.

    Volume Type	                            Min(GB)	    Max(GB)	    I/O per sec
    General Purpose SSD (gp2)	            1	        16384	    [100 - 3000] IOPS
    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) and (io2)	4	        16384	    [100-64000] IOPS
    Cold HDD (sc1)	                        500	        16384	    Not applicable
    Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)	        500	        16384	    Not applicable
    Magnetic (standard)	                    1	        1024	    100 IOPS (avg)

    According to AWS:

    General Purpose SSD volumes can serve at a rate of [100-3000] IOPS with a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GB.

    Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes can deliver up to 64000 IOPS, and are best for EBS-optimized instances.

    Cold HDD and Throughput Optimized HDD types of volume have their predefined throughput (MB/s) with a standard baseline.

    Magnetic volumes, previously called standard volumes, deliver 100 IOPS on average.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
-------------------------

    Virtual Private Cloud or VPC allows you to create your own private network in the cloud. You can launch services, like EC2, inside of that private network. A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region.

    VPC allows you to control your virtual networking environment, which includes:

    IP address ranges
    subnets
    route tables
    network gateways
    Tips
        VPC is found under Networking & Content Delivery section of the AWS Management Console.
        The default limit is 5 VPCs per Region. You can request an increase for these limits.
        Your AWS resources are automatically provisioned in a default VPC.
        There are no additional charges for creating and using the VPC.
        You can store data in Amazon S3 and restrict access so that it’s only accessible from instances in your VPC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VPC - Network ACL
-------------------------

    Definition - A network access control list (ACL) defines the set of firewall rules for controlling traffic coming in and out of subnets in your VPC.

    You can view the Network ACLs under the Security section in the left navigation pane of the VPC Dashboard. See a snapshot below:

    The details of the items highlighted in red in the snapshot above are:

    1. List of Network ACLs
        For each Network ACL in the list, view the ID, the count of associated subnets, whether it is a Default, the VPC Id to whom the network ACL is associated, and the owner ID.

    2. Details of the Selected Network ACL
        View the details of the selected Network ACL. In the snapshot above, it shows the details of a default Network ACL. Note that each VPC automatically gets associated with a modifiable default network ACL. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with any one network ACL. Whereas, a given network ACL can be associated with multiple subnets.

    Inbound/Outbound Rules
        The default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic, as shown in the snapshot above. However, you can create or edit the rules, anytime.

        Inbound/Outbound rules are numbered and ordered. The lowest numbered rule is evaluated first. In other words, the incoming/outgoing traffic to/from a given subnet follows the rules mentioned in the associated network ACL.

        Network ACLs are stateless in nature. Assume an inbound request arrived in your subnet. A "response" to the inbound request can only be sent out of the subnet if the outbound rules allow the outgoing traffic to the desired destination. A vice-versa scenario is also possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lambda
-------------------------
    AWS Lambda provides you with computing power in the cloud by allowing you to execute code without standing up or managing servers.

    Tips
        Lambda is found under the Compute section on the AWS Management Console.
        Lambdas have a time limit of 15 minutes.
        The code you run on AWS Lambda is called a “Lambda function.”
        Lambda code can be triggered by other AWS services.
        AWS Lambda supports Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#/.NET, Python, and Ruby. There is a Runtime API that allows you to use other programming languages to author your functions.
        Lambda code can be authored via the console.

Elastic Beanstalk
-------------------------

    Elastic Beanstalks is an orchestration service that allows you to deploy a web application at the touch of a button by spinning up (or provisioning) all of the services that you need to run your application.

    Tips
        Elastic Beanstalk is found under the Compute section of the AWS Management Console.
        Elastic Beanstalk can be used to deployed web applications developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.
        You can run your applications in a VPC.
