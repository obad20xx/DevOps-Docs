Cloud Trail
-------------------------

    Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.
    
    Features
    CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including:
        who has logged in
        services that were accessed
        actions performed
        parameters for the actions
        responses returned
        This includes actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.

    Tips
        Cloud Trail is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
        CloudTrail shows results for the last 90 days.
        You can create up to five trails in an AWS region.

Cloud Formation

    AWS Cloud Formation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file template allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write.

    Tips
        Cloud Formation is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
        Cloud Formation templates are written using JSON or YAML.
