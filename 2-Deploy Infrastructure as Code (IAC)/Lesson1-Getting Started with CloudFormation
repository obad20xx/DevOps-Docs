What is (Cloud) Infrastructure?
--------------------------------

    Cloud services are broadly categorized as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Cloud is a collection of geographically distributed data centers that are logically grouped into regions and availability-zones.

    The IaaS allows a user to provision Virtual Machines (VMs), set up networks (VPC), create subnets, and associate necessary security features. Further, VMs can be attached to storage volumes, different networks, or servers. All the resources mentioned above are referred to as Infrastructure.

    The diagram below shows various cloud infrastructure resources that we will learn to provision on the AWS cloud using the AWS command line and CloudFormation tools. These are the primary resources that are required to build a web app architecture.

What is DevOps?
--------------------------------

    DevOps is the combination of industry best practices, and set of tools that improve an organization’s ability to:

    Increase the speed of software delivery
    Increases the speed of software evolution
    Have better reliability of the software
    Have scalability using automation,
    Improved collaboration among teams.

    In other words, these tools enable a company to showcase industry best practices in software development.

    Issues that DevOps tries to solve:
        Unpredictable deployments
        Mismatched environments (development doesn’t match production)
        Configuration Drift

What are the benefits of Cloud DevOps?
--------------------------------

    DevOps best practices and tools
    One of the benefits of using DevOps is that it allows predictable deployments using automated scripts. In the DevOps model, development and operations teams are merged into a single team. These DevOps teams use a few tools and best practices that deploy and manage configuration changes to servers.

    The most important practices are:

        Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) - new features are automatically deployed with all the required dependencies.
        Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) - configuration and management of cloud infrastructure using re-usable scripts.
    Other prevalent practices are:

        Microservices
        Monitoring and Logging
        Communication and Collaboration

    Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Tracks the development workflow from testing through production. Continuous integration is the process flow of testing any change made to your development flow, while continuous deployment tracks those changes through to staging and production systems.

    Infrastructure as code (IaC): Provision and manages the cloud-infrastructure by using scripts. These scripts can be written in YAML or JSON format. These scripts ensure that the same architecture can be re-built multiple numbers of times. These scripts are particularly useful in enterprise applications and different environments - dev, prod, or test.

What is CloudFormation?
--------------------------------

    CloudFormation is an AWS tool for creating, managing, configuring, and deploying cloud resources. This tool is beneficial if you have to provision a set of cloud resources multiple times, at scale. You can do so by simply writing (YAML or JSON) scripts that you can easily edit and run numerous times. In the script, we mention each resource's necessary configuration that we want to provision and then use the AWS CLI tool and commands to execute the scripts.

Summary
--------------------------------

    must be able to...

        Describe IaaC as one of the best practices used in the DevOps model.
        Configure basic settings to start using AWS services as an IAM user.
        Explain the fundamentals of Cloud Formation.
        Contrast the manual vs. automated provisioning of EC2 instances in a VPC.
        Utilize the AWS command-line tool - CLI for necessary activities, such as configuring a VPC, or creating an IAM user.
